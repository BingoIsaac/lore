MC server status and changelogs information.
The server has a whitelist and is currently private, as it is just a server for my friends and I (when I'm in the mood) to play on.

This would not be possible without 'mcapi.us'. Which is the API I am using to get the status of the server.
I might also use Cloudflare Workers as a way to get the changelog information. I'm not a good programmer OK??
